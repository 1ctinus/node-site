        | ever since January 2021, I have been a linux user. I first started out with
        a(href='https://ubuntucinnamon.org') Ubuntu Cinnamon. 
        |Before that, I tried Mint and Ubuntu MATE. I could never get it working due do a peice of crap called 'RST' (or as I think it should stand for Really Stupid Technology)
        | I finally got it to work with ~70 Gigabytes of storage. I customized it and thought it was good, not realizing until later how terrible it looked. 
    p
        | Then, after getting bored
        | of Cinnamon, I decided to try out something called i3 from all the wonderful, albeit extremely similar posts on 
        a(href='https://reddit.com/r/unixporn') r/unixporn.
        | (don't worry, it's safe for work. Just Linux Screenshots.)
        | I wanted to try out 'i3-gaps', a fork of i3, but with gaps. The issue? It's not on apt, so I decided to go with normal i3. And? It sucked, I hated the keybinds.
        | so I tried out this thing called bspwm, the second most common wm. And? I liked it. One of my favorite parts was how easy sxhkd was to configure. 
    p
        | Sometime, I decided to flash Arch to an ISO. I could not find the empty partition, so I gave up. (not the worst thing to happen on a first time Arch installation!)
        | I made my own theme on Gruvbox, later switching to a theme that is similar to Arc? I decided to flatten everything to one color,
        span(style='background-color:#10121b')  #10121b
        | , Which is the theme I am using as of March 9. I decided to install Arch again in a VM, which went well. During a long weekend of mine, I finally found that USB
        | and reflashed Arch onto it, and, after a stressful few hours, it worked! I installed BSPWM onto it and copied my dotfiles. 
    p
        | After a dream I had, I decided to switch from bspwm to xmonad, the wm I am using right now. I honestly prefer bspwm better, but I think there's a brighter future
        | with Xmonad. I also don't know Haskell. Also, I had a 6 hour period where my sound and webcam weren't working on a school day. Splendid.
